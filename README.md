#CTRL+SPACE Standard Blueprint Library (SBL)

## What is a CTRL+SPACE Blueprint

You know Smartphone apps? Good, Blueprints are like apps that extend the Smartphone OS, though they are not running on an Operating System but on an IDE! The IDE is the OS.

## Which Blueprints are part of the SBL

To enjoy the power of CTRL+SPACE, the basic version comes with some predefined Blueprints - the Standard Blueprint Library.
They cover very basic usescases, for example reading a margin value from a CSImage file or create images from it.

A full list of available SBL Blueprints is shown in the [CTRL+SPACE Documentation](https://control-space.projektmotor.de/dokumentation/en/user/what_is_a_blueprint "CTRL+SPACE Documentation").
